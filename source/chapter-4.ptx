  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are three reasons for the double section reference:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The section on Markov Chains appeared as Section 4.9 in older editions of the textbook and appears as Section 5.9 in the newest edition.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I like covering Markov Chains before beginning Chapter 5 as it offers a nice segue.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Pretext does not allow me to skip Chapter Numbers, so if I didn't include this section in Chapter 4 (even though it is in Chapter 5), we would have a blank Chapter 4 which would be weird.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
